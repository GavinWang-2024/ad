# NGM Company project

## About the project:

NGM Company is a landing page for a real local business company, which was designed & developed by me from scratch. This project page massively uses animations and visual effects, like particle effects. The app also supports a feature of sending e-mails right from the main page to the company's mail for business inqueries. 
The page is hosted on a real domain https://www.ngmcompany.ru/.
